# asdnet
This is the pytorch code of the proposed asdnet for medical image segmentation. Currently, I just uploaded the initial version, I donot make any clean for the codes since I'm quite busy recently. I will clean the code later, and upload some other pieces of codes.

Main entrance: runGAN.py or runGAN_supervised.py
